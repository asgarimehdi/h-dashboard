# Plan 027: Add Livewire coverage for tickets.inbox

> **Executor instructions**: Follow this plan step by step. Run every
> verification command and confirm the expected result before moving to the
> next step. If anything in the "STOP conditions" section occurs, stop and
> report — do not improvise. When done, update the status row for this plan
> in `plans/README.md`.
>
> **Drift check (run first)**: `git diff --stat af29080..HEAD -- tests/`
> If any test file changed since this plan was written, compare the
> "Current state" excerpts against the live code before proceeding; on a
> mismatch, treat it as a STOP condition.

## Status

- **Priority**: P1
- **Effort**: L
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Depends on**: none
- **Category**: tests
- **Planned at**: commit `af29080`, 2026-09-03
- **Issue**: https://github.com/asgarimehdi/h-dashboard/issues/588

## Why this matters

The `tickets.inbox` Livewire component currently has **no dedicated Livewire test
coverage**. Adding Pest tests via `Livewire::test()` ensures that auth gates,
scope filtering, interactions, and edge cases are verified — preventing
regressions and documenting expected behavior for future contributors.

## Current state

- **Component**: `tickets.inbox` — single-file anonymous Livewire 4 class under
  `resources/views/livewire/` (see AGENTS.md: no `app/Livewire/*.php` files).
- **Route**: `/tickets/inbox` — protected by `view_assigned_tickets (+auth+unit_context)` (see `routes/web.php`).
- **Conventions**: Pest tests under `tests/Feature/`, run via `composer test`.
  Model after `tests/Feature/ActivityLogPageLivewireTest.php` and
  `tests/Feature/HrLivewireTest.php`.
- **Key services**: `AccessService::accessibleUnitIds()` for org-scope
  filtering (recursive CTE, cached, version-invalidated).
- **Auth**: session-based for Livewire (`actingAs`); Sanctum Bearer tokens NOT
  accepted for Livewire pages.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose | Command | Expected on success |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Start DB | `docker compose -f docker-compose-pgsql-.yml up -d` | PostGIS healthy on :5432 |
| Config clear | `php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear` | No stale caches |
| Run focused | `XDEBUG_MODE=off php artisan test tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php` | All pass |
| Full suite | `composer test` | All pass (928 baseline) |
| Format | `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` | Clean |

## Scope

**In scope** (the ONLY file you may create/modify):
- `tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php` (CREATE)

**Out of scope** (do NOT touch, even though they look related):
- Any production source file (`app/`, `resources/views/`, `routes/`)
- Any existing test file
- Config, migrations, seeders, `composer.json`, `package.json`

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify current state on disk

Open the component file and the route definition yourself; confirm paths and
middleware match "Current state" above. Record any drift as a STOP.

```bash
ls resources/views/livewire/tickets/inbox.blade.php
grep -n "tickets.inbox" routes/web.php
grep -rn "Livewire::test(\"tickets.inbox\")" tests/ | head -5
```

**Verify**: component file exists; route line matches; no existing dedicated
test file for this component.

### Step 2: Write the test file skeleton with setUp helper

Create `tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php` following the exemplar pattern below
(adapted from `tests/Feature/ActivityLogPageLivewireTest.php`):

- `use RefreshDatabase;`
- `setUp()`: seed `PermissionSeeder::class`, then insert lookup rows with
  explicit ids into `tahsils`, `estekhdams`, `semats`, `radifs`
  (id=1, name='Test' each)
- helper `createUserWithUnit(string $perm)`: create `Unit`, create `Person`
  (n_code = 10-digit unique string, f_name/l_name, t_id/e_id/s_id/r_id = 1,
  u_id = unit id), create `User` (n_code + hashed password),
  `$user->givePermissionTo($perm)`, attach unit via `user_units` pivot with
  `['role' => 'staff', 'is_primary' => true]`
- where the route needs it: `Session::put('current_unit_id', $unit->id)`

NOTE: When seeding rows with explicit IDs, resync the Postgres sequence
afterwards (`SELECT setval(...)`) or later inserts hit duplicate keys.

**Verify**: `XDEBUG_MODE=off php artisan test tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php`
→ file loads (may have 0 tests yet, but no fatal).

### Step 3: Add smoke tests

Write test methods for:
- guest request → 302 to `/login`
- authenticated user WITHOUT the required permission → 403
- authenticated user WITH permission (+ `current_unit_id` session where
  required) → 200 and component-specific content visible (`assertSee`)

**Verify**: focused test run → all smoke tests pass.

### Step 4: Add interaction tests

- S1: Guest 302, no-perm 403, authed 200 + header; empty units -> empty state
- S2: received (Ticket::accessible scope via accessibleUnitIds) vs sent (assignee/current_assignee/activities.user_id)
- S3: statusFilter pending/all/completed/forwarded/accepted + query constraints
- S4: search subject/code/content
- S5: Jalali dateFrom/dateTo -> Miladi bounds
- S6: updateFilter/switchView reset page + statusFilter pending
- S7: showTicket in-scope loads relations else error; closeDetail resets
- S8: acceptTicket (created/forwarded -> accepted + assignee + accepted_at + activity; already-accepted warning; out-of-scope 404)
- S9: rejectTicket -> rejected
- S10: forward validates targetUnitId, updates unit + forwarded + activity
- S11: Bulk: toggleTicketSelection/toggleSelectAll/openBulkModal(empty warning)/executeBulkAction(complete vs forward: transaction, TaskActivity batch, cache increment, Todo auto-complete)
- S12: submitAction forwarded vs completed path + completionNote validation + completionFiles (array max5, mimes, 5120) + attachments + notifyUnit + removeFile.

Use `Livewire::test('tickets.inbox')` with `actingAs($user)`; assert state with
`assertSet`, events with `assertDispatched`, validation with
`assertHasErrors`, DB effects with `assertDatabaseHas`/`assertDatabaseMissing`.

**Verify**: focused test run → all interaction tests pass.

### Step 5: Add edge-case tests

- E1: Invalid Jalali -> validation error
- E2: Concurrent accept (SELECT FOR UPDATE) -> second sees changed -> warning
- E3: executeBulkAction only-completed -> warning
- E4: forward without targetUnitId -> validation error
- E5: updatedSearch/updatedStatusFilter reset pagination
- E6: Storage::fake for uploads.

**Verify**: focused test run → all edge tests pass.

### Step 6: Format and run the full gate

```bash
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
composer test
```

**Verify**: both commands exit 0; no regressions in the full suite.

## Test plan

New tests to write in `tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php` (model structure on
`tests/Feature/ActivityLogPageLivewireTest.php`):

- `test_guest_302`
- `test_unauthorized_403`
- `test_view_modes`
- `test_status_filters`
- `test_search`
- `test_jalali_dates`
- `test_show_ticket_scope`
- `test_accept_ticket`
- `test_reject_ticket`
- `test_forward`
- `test_bulk_actions`
- `test_submit_action`
- `test_file_uploads`

## Done criteria

Machine-checkable. ALL must hold:

- [ ] Focused run `XDEBUG_MODE=off php artisan test tests/Feature/TicketsInboxLivewireTest.php` exits 0
- [ ] Every method in "Test plan" exists and passes
- [ ] `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` reports no changes
- [ ] `git status -- tests/` shows ONLY the new test file
- [ ] `plans/README.md` status row updated to DONE

## STOP conditions

Stop and report back (do not improvise) if:

- The component file does not exist at the expected path (codebase drifted).
- A focused test run fails due to environment (PostGIS down, config cache,
  Redis NOAUTH) — fix env first via AGENTS.md checklist, do not relax asserts.
- The component needs a permission or middleware not listed in "Current
  state" — report, do not guess.
- A step's verification fails twice after a reasonable fix attempt.
- The work appears to require touching an out-of-scope file.

## Maintenance notes

- For the owner of this code afterwards: if filters/actions are added to the
  component, add the matching `Livewire::test` method in the same file.
- A reviewer should scrutinize: auth/permission branches, scope assertions
  (`accessibleUnitIds`), and that no production file was modified.
